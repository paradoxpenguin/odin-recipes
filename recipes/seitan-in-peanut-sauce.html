<h1>Seitan in Peanut Sauce</h1>
<img src="../images/seitan-in-peanut-sauce.webp" alt="Seitan in Peanut Sauce">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This is a delicious modification of a classic Thai dish!
    You've probably had the chicken version if you're a meat eater,
    and I'm sure you could substitute meat for the seitan, however, I urge you to give the seitan a try.
    Seitan is a meat substitute made from wheat gluten.
    Seitan comes the closest to real meat that a vegetarian or vegan can have.
    Seitan really picks up the flavor of whatever marinade it's put into.
    If you've ever had 'mock duck' at a Thai restaurant, then you've had seitan before.
    It can be found at natural food or Asian food stores.
